Is insanity compulsory?","No, declares Gita wisdom. All of us are souls who are originally characterized by not just sanity, but also serenity and even felicity. The Bhagavad-Gita (14: 13) indicates that insane behaviour (pramada) results from the predomination of the mode of ignorance in our mind. This accumulated mode of ignorance first sabotages our normal intelligence (aprakasha), then distorts our normal behavioral pattern (apravrtti), and finally impels us to self-destructive actions.","Among the three modes, the mode of ignorance is the lowest and the basest. That\'s why it perverts our original nature the most. Thankfully, this perversion, no matter how detrimental, is never irreversible. All of us have the power to reclaim our original pure nature. For this return to purity, we need to consciously expose ourselves to places (e.g. temples), people (e.g. devotees), actions (e.g. chanting), and emotions (e.g. ecstasy in kirtans) that are surcharged with spirituality. These transcendental stimuli revoke the influences of ignorance and invoke our dormant spiritual tendencies. The more we practice the art of exposing ourselves to transcendental influences, the more we become situated in our spiritual nature.","The ultimate transcendental influence - in fact, the source of all transcendental influences - is Krishna himself. When we expose ourselves to him internally by constantly thinking of him, then his presence in our consciousness protects us from all possible negative influences. Constant thought of Krishna is the best in security and is eventually the source of the supreme everlasting ecstasy."],"intro":["We have probably witnessed normal sane people suddenly behaving abnormally, even insanely.

All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse.","Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life. In the B\u1e5bhad-\u0101ra\u1e47yaka Upani\u1e63ad (3.8.10) the perplexed man is described as follows: yo v\u0101 etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgy aviditv\u0101sm\u0101\u1e3b lok\u0101t praiti sa k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a\u1e25. \u201cHe is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization.\u201d This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity, who can utilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser. On the other hand, there is the br\u0101hma\u1e47a, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life. Ya etad ak\u1e63ara\u1e41 g\u0101rgi viditv\u0101sm\u0101l lok\u0101t praiti sa br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u1e25.","The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47as, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life. One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of \u201cskin disease.\u201d The k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the k\u1e5bpa\u1e47a thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death. Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals, who take care of children also. Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes of his perplexities. Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties. He is therefore asking Lord K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution. He offers himself to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a disciple. He wants to stop friendly talks. Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the G\u012bt\u0101. How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101 is stated in the G\u012bt\u0101 itself. And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as a person, but to \u201cthe unborn within K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a.\u201d There is no difference between K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u2019s within and without.

It may make us claim credit for successes that have actually been achieved primarily by the grace of Krishna and only secondarily by our endeavors.

Let\'s see how.","The Gita begins by explaining that we are souls who are presently misidentifying with our body due to the insidious influence of the false ego. Under the spell of the false ego, we mistake its desires to be our own desires. This misjudgment makes casting those desires aside seem like giving up something very significant.","However, if we unsentimentally contemplate the false ego\u2019s desires, we will realize that fulfilling them will yield insignificant results: we might at best get some fleeting pleasure that will keep us bound to material existence, chasing the same pleasures that countless other living entities are chasing. That\'s why as long as we stay wedded to those desires, we sentence ourselves to obscurity in material existence, thereby sealing our pact with insignificance.","To help us attain real significance, the Bhagavad Gita (18.58) urges us to harmonize our desires with Krishna\u2019s desires and to put aside all other desires, recognizing them to be what they are; the false ego\u2019s allurements. When we choose to apply this Gita injunction, we can endure the resulting temporary feelings of insignificance by philosophical conviction. Our bold choice and determined endurance will attract divine grace. That grace will empower us to pass over all obstacles and render significant devotional service, thereby facilitating many other souls in coming closer to Krishna.

The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Ved\u0101nta-s\u016btra (1.1.4) confirms this in the following words: tat tu samanvay\u0101t. One can attain perfection in three stages. By understanding Vedic literature one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by performing the different processes one can approach Him, and at the end one can attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Spiritual growth essentially means growth in our faith that Krishna is our greatest well wisher and that he is, as the Bhagavad Gita (9.10) asserts, overseeing the world.","Faith grows by both human choice and divine grace. When we are about to give up due to material failures, we have a special opportunity to grow in faith by exerting our human choice and thereby attracting divine grace. Let\'s see how.","Amidst reversals, all of us can make the choice of putting faith in Krishna by not getting disheartened and by continuing to serve him as much as our capacities and circumstances allow. When we thus persevere with faith, we will in due course of time discover that he has arranged things for our ultimate good in a way far better than our best plans. This inconceivable arrangement and our realization of that arrangement comprise the divine grace that further boosts our faith and accelerates our spiritual growth.","Thus, when we utilise the power of faith, reversals will no longer remain cause to give up, but will become opportunities to grow up."],"intro":["Life\u2019s inevitable reversals sometimes fill us with defeatist thoughts: \u201cI have had yet again.
